# 1. Introduction

Academic entrepreneurship has emerged as a defining phenomenon of contemporary higher education, fundamentally reshaping the relationship between universities and economic development. Over the past three decades, scholars have documented how academic scientists transform knowledge into commercial ventures, how technology transfer offices (TTOs) orchestrate licensing, and how university spinoffs contribute to regional innovation. Our analysis identifies 1,294 unique publications spanning 1988 to 2025, accumulating 44,190 citations across 497 journals. While this indicates scientific maturity, it presents a significant managerial challenge: as the field consolidates, the traditional frameworks used by administrators to monitor the research-to-market pipeline are becoming increasingly ill-equipped to handle the volatility of the digital age.

Beneath the consolidation mentioned above lies a troubling paradox with profound managerial implications. Despite intensifying policy mandates for digital transformation, our semantic analysis reveals that Digital Academic Entrepreneurship remains a peripheral semantic cluster, accounting for only 2% of the scholarly corpus—a weak signal that is nearly invisible within the dominant thematic architecture. This finding resonates with warnings that digitalization fundamentally challenges established organizational logics and performance metrics. As highlighted by Ciampi et al. (2022) and Urbinati et al. (2020), while digital technologies enable organizational agility and open innovation, their specific impact on university-centered ecosystems remains empirically underexplored. This creates an Invisibility Paradox: the very phenomena most likely to reshape academic commercialization remain systematically undertheorized, leaving university managers without evidence-based guidance precisely when they need it most.

The scholarly development of academic entrepreneurship reflects a productive tension between competing institutional logics. The academic logic—emphasizing open science, peer recognition, and knowledge as a public good—has historically contested the entrepreneurial logic—prioritizing market orientation, proprietary protection, and commercial value capture (Fini & Toschi, 2016). Contemporary research suggests that these logics have progressively hybridized, with universities developing selective coupling mechanisms that enable simultaneous pursuit of scientific excellence and commercial engagement (Perkmann et al., 2013; Bouncken & Kraus, 2022).

However, this very integration generates an unintended consequence with direct implications for management practice: the systematic obscuring of emergent phenomena. When established logics successfully hybridize, their shared terminological space absorbs and diffuses new concepts before they can crystallize into distinct research streams. Digital transformation enters academic entrepreneurship discourse not as a rival logic but as a parasitic logic—occupying familiar terminological niches (innovation, technology transfer, platforms) while fundamentally altering their semantic meaning. The digital frontier remains invisible precisely because it speaks the language of the established order.

We pose three interconnected research questions to address this gap:

**RQ1**: How does the hybridization of institutional logics manifest in the semantic structure of academic entrepreneurship literature?

**RQ2**: What explains the emergence of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship as a weak signal—visible to transformer-based semantic embeddings (BERTopic) yet dispersed and undetectable through probabilistic topic modeling (LDA)?

**RQ3**: How can multilevel theory illuminate the dynamics through which a nascent digital logic is entering the established hybrid space?

These questions respond to the call for multilevel research. Our analysis spans the micro-level (individual scientist motivations), the meso-level (TTOs as digital orchestrators), and the macro-level (innovation ecosystems). We demonstrate how macro-level institutional shifts toward platforms alter meso-level coordination by TTOs, which in turn redefine micro-level career trajectories for PhD students—who often act as digital bridge-builders between scientific code and platform-based ventures.

Along these lines, this study offers four distinct contributions that respond to both scholarly and managerial imperatives. Theoretically, we extend institutional logics theory by demonstrating how successful logic hybridization can paradoxically obscure emergent phenomena, introducing the concept of parasitic logics that occupy established semantic spaces while transforming their fundamental meaning. Also, our multilevel framework demonstrates how the macro-level institutional shift toward digital platforms alters meso-level organizational orchestration by TTOs and accelerators, ultimately redefining micro-level individual career paths of PhD students. Methodologically, we develop and validate a triangulation framework for weak signal detection, demonstrating the comparative advantages of transformer-based semantic analysis over frequency-based approaches. This offers management scholars a replicable protocol for detecting emergent phenomena before they achieve sufficient lexical distinctiveness for conventional detection. Empirically, we provide the most comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic entrepreneurship to date, spanning 37 years of scholarly production across 1,294 publications. Practically, our study exposes a success trap in university management where traditional monitoring tools inadvertently mask disruptive shifts. By contrasting frequency-based metrics with semantic-based insights, we demonstrate that emerging digital initiatives are often misclassified within consolidated organizational buckets, such as traditional university spin-offs or standard technology transfer protocols. This misclassification creates a false sense of thematic continuity, leading university managers to over-invest in physical infrastructures (e.g., traditional wet labs or brick-and-mortar incubators) while remaining blind to the specific infrastructural and regulatory needs of platform-mediated ventures.

In order to make the contributions described above, the manuscript proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops our theoretical framework within institutional logics and weak signals theories. Section 3 details our methodological approach, including network analysis, historical trajectory mapping, and contrastive semantic analysis. Section 4 presents results. Section 5 discusses theoretical and managerial implications. Section 6 concludes with contributions, limitations, and a future research agenda.
