# 2. Intellectual Foundations and Knowledge Trajectories

The evolution of academic entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain cannot be understood in isolation from its intellectual antecedents. This section employs two complementary bibliometric techniques—Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) and Main Path Analysis (MPA)—to trace the field's historical foundations and map the central trajectory of knowledge accumulation. Our analysis reveals a field that has achieved remarkable integration, yet this very maturity creates conditions that systematically obscure emergent phenomena such as digitalization.

## 2.1 Historical Roots: A Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy Analysis

To identify the intellectual foundations upon which contemporary academic entrepreneurship scholarship rests, we conducted Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) analysis of 90,252 cited references extracted from our corpus of 1,294 source documents. RPYS identifies "root works" by detecting years in which cited references significantly exceed expected citation frequencies, revealing the seminal contributions that anchored subsequent theoretical development. As shown in Table 1, the field's foundations are deeply rooted in Schumpeterian dynamics of creative destruction, subsequently enriched by network theory and behavioral psychology.

**Table 1: Intellectual Foundations of Academic Entrepreneurship (RPYS Analysis)**

| Year | Citations | Seminal Work | Key Contribution | Theoretical Domain |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1912/1934 | 59 | Schumpeter – *Theory of Economic Development* | Entrepreneur as agent of creative destruction | Innovation Economics |
| 1945 | 18 | Bush – *Science, The Endless Frontier* | Linear model; university as innovation engine | Science Policy |
| 1962 | 70 | Arrow – *Rate of Invention* | Knowledge as public good; appropriability problem | Economics of Innovation |
| 1973 | 118 | Granovetter – *Strength of Weak Ties* | Bridging ties enable knowledge diffusion | Network Theory |
| 1986 | 390 | Kenney – *Biotechnology: University-Industrial Complex* | University-industry relations in biotech | Industrial Organization |
| 1991 | 764 | Ajzen – *Theory of Planned Behavior*; Barney – *RBV* | Intentions, capabilities, resources | Behavioral/Strategic Management |

*Note: Based on analysis of 90,252 cited references. Citation counts represent aggregate references to works published in each peak year.*

The trajectory revealed in Table 1 demonstrates a clear intellectual evolution from macro-level economic theory toward meso-level organizational dynamics and, ultimately, micro-level behavioral analysis. Schumpeter's foundational conceptualization of the entrepreneur as the disruptive agent of economic transformation established the theoretical vocabulary that continues to underpin research on academic commercialization. Vannevar Bush's 1945 report to President Truman articulated the linear model of innovation wherein basic research conducted in universities cascades through applied research to commercial application—providing the policy architecture within which academic entrepreneurship would eventually flourish.

The mid-century contributions of Arrow and Granovetter deserve particular attention for their contemporary relevance. Arrow's analysis of knowledge as a public good characterized by non-rivalrous consumption and imperfect appropriability continues to inform debates about intellectual property and open science. Granovetter's network-theoretic insight that bridging ties connecting otherwise disconnected communities are disproportionately valuable for knowledge diffusion directly informs our finding that the keyword co-occurrence network exhibits exceptional density (0.8424). This remarkable density reflects the degree to which Granovetter's relational perspective has permeated the field, creating an integrated terminological space where thematic boundaries have dissolved.

The biotechnology revolution of the 1980s, documented by Kenney (1986), catalyzed unprecedented engagement between research universities and commercial enterprises, generating the institutional innovations—from the Bayh-Dole Act to the proliferation of TTOs—that define contemporary academic entrepreneurship. The theoretical infrastructure for studying individual-level entrepreneurial behavior arrived with Ajzen's 1991 Theory of Planned Behavior, which provided the psychological scaffolding for investigating entrepreneurial intentions and identity formation among academic scientists.

## 2.2 The Main Path: From Descriptive Accounts to Theoretical Frameworks

While RPYS identifies the field's intellectual roots, Main Path Analysis (MPA) reveals the central trajectory of knowledge accumulation within the citing literature itself. Using Search Path Count (SPC) methodology applied to 231 internal citations among our 1,294 source documents, we identified 20 key papers that constitute the "backbone" of knowledge flow in academic entrepreneurship. Table 2 synthesizes this trajectory, revealing a clear progression through four distinct phases that culminate at the threshold of digital transformation.

**Table 2: The Knowledge Backbone – Main Path Evolution**

| Phase | Period | Key Authors | Representative Works | Citations | Core Focus |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| I. Emergence | 2001–2007 | Anonymous; Toole & Czarnitzki | SBIR program analysis; descriptive spinoff accounts | 75 | Policy mechanisms; phenomenological documentation |
| II. Theoretical Consolidation | 2008–2009 | Wright, M.; Clarysse, B.; Lockett, A. | Mid-range universities; Business schools | 420 | Knowledge transfer frameworks; intermediary roles |
| III. Behavioral Turn | 2011–2017 | Hayter, C.S.; Hmieleski, K.M. | Motivations; graduate students; psychological foundations | 271 | Individual agency; identity; non-profit motivations |
| IV. Digital Diversification | 2019–2021 | Secundo, G.; Meijer, L.; Doanh, D.C. | Digital Academic Entrepreneurship; sustainability | 168 | Digitalization; emerging economies; sustainable tech |

*Note: Citations represent aggregate counts for phase-defining works on the main path. Phase boundaries determined by thematic shifts in SPC-weighted citation flows.*

As Table 2 illustrates, the main path terminates precisely at the threshold of digital transformation. The earliest entries (Phase I) consist primarily of descriptive accounts documenting the phenomenological emergence of university spinoffs and policy instruments such as the SBIR program. Theory remained underdeveloped during this period.

The main path undergoes a decisive theoretical turn with the contributions of Wright and colleagues (Phase II). Wright, Clarysse, Lockett, and Knockaert's 2008 *Research Policy* article (333 citations—the most cited paper on the main path) analyzed how "mid-range universities" contribute to industrial change through diverse knowledge transfer mechanisms, introducing the distinction between tacit and codified knowledge flows. Their 2009 follow-up examined business schools' role in academic entrepreneurship through resource-based and institutional lenses. Collectively, these contributions established the theoretical vocabulary—knowledge transfer mechanisms, university-industry linkages, intermediary roles—that continues to structure scholarly discourse.

Phase III reflects a marked shift toward individual-level analysis. Hayter's 2011 study (112 citations), "In search of the profit-maximizing actor," challenged the assumption that academic entrepreneurs are motivated primarily by financial gain, revealing a complex mosaic of motivations including intellectual curiosity and social impact. His 2017 contribution with Lubynsky and Maroulis (103 citations) identified graduate students as critical but overlooked agents in university spinoff development—a finding that foreshadows our identification of PhD students as emerging digital bridge-builders.

The Digital Diversification phase (Phase IV) marks the transition currently underway. Secundo, Rippa, and Cerchione's 2020 structured literature review on "Digital Academic Entrepreneurship" (110 citations) represents the first systematic attempt to theorize the impact of digital technologies on university-based knowledge commercialization. This work provides conceptual grounding for understanding how AI, big data, and platformization are transforming the entrepreneurial landscape—yet remains, as our semantic analysis demonstrates, a peripheral signal within the consolidated core.

## 2.3 The Contemporary Turn: Diversification and the Digital Frontier

The temporal evolution revealed by RPYS and MPA must be situated within the contemporary landscape of keyword bursts and thematic shifts detected in the 2024–2025 publication window. Our burst detection analysis, comparing recent keyword frequencies against historical baselines using Z-score methodology, reveals significant emergent themes that signal the future trajectory of academic entrepreneurship research. Table 3 presents the most pronounced keyword bursts, offering empirical grounding for the emergent research fronts.

**Table 3: Emerging Research Fronts and Keyword Bursts (2024–2025)**

| Rank | Keyword | Z-Score | Emergence Pattern | Multilevel Interpretation |
|------|---------|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Sustainable Entrepreneurship | 8.96 | Sharp acceleration | Macro: Policy alignment with SDGs |
| 2 | Ecosystems | 7.35 | Steady growth | Macro/Meso: Systems perspective on innovation |
| 3 | Sustainability | 8.03 | Sustained presence | Macro: Grand challenges integration |
| 4 | **PhD Students / Doctoral Students** | **5.92** | **Breakthrough** | **Micro: New entrepreneurial agents** |
| 5 | Lean Startup | 5.92 | Methodological adoption | Meso: Agile commercialization practices |
| 6 | Accelerators | 5.92 | Infrastructure expansion | Meso: Intermediary diversification |
| 7 | Resilience | 5.92 | Post-pandemic emphasis | Micro/Meso: Adaptive capacity focus |

*Note: Z-scores calculated against 2019–2023 baseline frequencies. Values >3.0 indicate statistically significant bursts at p<0.01.*

As shown in Table 3, the emergence of "PhD Students" and "Doctoral Students" as bursting keywords (Z = 5.92) warrants particular attention. When triangulated with Hayter et al.'s (2017) identification of graduate students as critical entrepreneurial agents, this signal suggests that early-career researchers are increasingly recognized as pivotal actors in academic entrepreneurship. Our multilevel framework posits that PhD students occupy a unique structural position: they possess both the technical depth to develop platform-based ventures and the career flexibility to navigate the tensions between scientific credibility and entrepreneurial agility. As digital natives operating at the interface of academic research and code-based innovation, doctoral students may represent the "armed wing" of the digital transformation our analysis detects.

The sustainability-related bursts (Z = 8.96 for Sustainable Entrepreneurship; Z = 8.03 for Sustainability) reflect the integration of environmental and social concerns into academic commercialization discourse, aligning university knowledge transfer with the Sustainable Development Goals. The emergence of "Ecosystems" (Z = 7.35) signals growing adoption of systems-level perspectives that situate university spinoffs within broader innovation networks—a conceptual shift that enables analysis of how digital platforms reconfigure the architecture of academic commercialization.

### 2.3.1 The Parasitic Logic Thesis

The preceding analysis reveals a paradox that motivates our methodological approach. Academic entrepreneurship has achieved unprecedented theoretical maturity and empirical consolidation—evidenced by the exceptionally low network modularity (0.0408) indicating minimal thematic fragmentation. Yet this very integration creates conditions that obscure emergent phenomena. When a field's keyword network becomes so densely interconnected that nearly all terms co-occur with all others, novel concepts lack the distinctive lexical signatures that enable their identification.

Digital transformation enters academic entrepreneurship discourse not as an external shock generating new terminology, but as a *parasitic logic* that colonizes existing terms—"innovation," "platforms," "technology transfer"—while fundamentally altering their semantic referents. This thesis explains why Digital Academic Entrepreneurship, despite its transformative potential, remains a peripheral semantic cluster comprising only 2% of the corpus in our BERTopic analysis. The digital frontier is invisible not because it is absent, but because it speaks the language of the established order.

Traditional bibliometric methods, dependent on frequency-based keyword differentiation, cannot detect signals embedded within consolidated terminological spaces. The methodological implications are clear: identifying emergent logics within mature, hybridized fields requires analytical tools capable of semantic discrimination beyond lexical frequency—a requirement that motivates our contrastive deployment of transformer-based topic modeling, to which we now turn.
