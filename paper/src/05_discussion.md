# 5. Discussion

<!-- 
WRITING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Target: ~1,500 words
- Interpret results through theoretical lens
- Connect to research questions
- Discuss implications for theory and practice
- Address the "weak signal" finding in depth
-->

## 5.1 Theoretical Implications

### 5.1.1 Hybridization of Institutional Logics
[Interpret high network density (0.8424) and low modularity (0.0408) as evidence of logic hybridization]

### 5.1.2 The Weak Signal Phenomenon
[Discuss why BERTopic detected Digital while LDA failed - implications for bibliometric methodology]

### 5.1.3 Multilevel Dynamics
[Connect Main Path evolution to micro-meso-macro theoretical framework]

## 5.2 The Digital Frontier as Emergent Logic

### 5.2.1 Characterization
- Only 2% of corpus (25 documents)
- Low bibliometric overlap (10%)
- Keywords: digital, technologies, platforms, learning

### 5.2.2 Why Invisible to Traditional Methods?
[Discuss lexical dispersion - "digital" vocabulary embedded in broader themes like innovation, technology transfer]

## 5.3 Practical Implications

### 5.3.1 For University Administrators
[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 5.3.2 For Policy Makers
[TO BE WRITTEN]

### 5.3.3 For Researchers
[TO BE WRITTEN - methodological implications of weak signal detection]

## 5.4 Comparison with Prior Work

[Compare findings with Secundo et al. (2020), Wright et al. (2008)]
