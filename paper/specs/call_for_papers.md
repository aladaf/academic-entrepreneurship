# Call for Papers: Review of Managerial Science (RMS)
## Special Issue: Academic Entrepreneurship and the Evolving University Spinoff Ecosystems

---

### 1. Overview and Scope
University spinoffs are pivotal vehicles for transforming academic knowledge into technological, social, and commercial innovation. This Special Issue (SI) focuses on the "hybrid logics" of institutional settings where scientific ideals must balance market demands and public policy objectives.

**The Research Gap**: While entrepreneurial ecosystems are well-theorized, university-specific configurations remain conceptually underdeveloped and empirically underexplored.

### 2. Core Objective: Integrative Multilevel Research
The SI invites research intersecting:
* **Micro-level**: Microfoundations of academic entrepreneurship (identity, motivation, career mobility).
* **Meso-level**: Roles of intermediaries (TTOs, incubators, venture funds) in coordination and governance.
* **Macro-level**: Ecosystem structures, performance dynamics, and national innovation systems.

### 3. Key Thematic Areas
* **Institutional Logics**: Managing competing academic, commercial, and public-sector logics.
* **Microfoundations**: Identity formation and entrepreneurial intentions among scientists.
* **Intermediary Roles**: Influence of TTOs, accelerators, and university-affiliated VC.
* **Network Structures**: Relational embeddedness across academia, industry, and policy.
* **Performance & Legitimacy**: Evaluating ecosystem-wide outcomes and societal impact beyond financial success.
* **Digitalization (Primary Interest)**: How AI, big data, and platformization influence spinoff success and ecosystem coordination.
* **Comparative Arrangements**: Differences across national systems and higher education structures.

### 4. Critical Research Questions (Prioritized)
1.  How do academic entrepreneurs navigate tensions between scientific values and entrepreneurial demands?
2.  What performance indicators are most relevant beyond financial outcomes?
3.  **How do digital technologies and data infrastructures shape ecosystem transparency and growth?**
4.  How do ecosystem dynamics differ across countries and policy environments?
