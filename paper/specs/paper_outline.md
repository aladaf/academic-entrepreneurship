# Strategic Manuscript Outline: The Digital Invisible
**Working Title:** *The Digital Invisible: Semantic Frontiers and the Multilevel Evolution of Academic Entrepreneurship (1988–2025)*

---

## 1. Introduction: The Paradox of Digital Visibility
* **Contextual Background**: Academic entrepreneurship has reached scientific maturity, characterized by exponential growth (1,294 unique records; 44,190 citations).
* **The Problematic**: Despite policy mandates for digital transformation, semantic frontier analysis reveals that "Digital Academic Entrepreneurship" occupies a mere 2% "weak signal" within the corpus.
* **The Research Gap**: Traditional frequency-based models fail to isolate emerging digital themes, leading to an "invisibility trap" in management metrics.
* **Research Question**: How does the "Digital Logic" hybridize with traditional academic commercialization, and why do conventional bibliometric tools fail to detect this frontier?

## 2. Intellectual Foundations & Knowledge Trajectories
* **Historical Roots (RPYS)**: Trace the field’s lineage from Schumpeterian economics (1912) and Bush’s "Endless Frontier" (1945) to Granovetter’s social network theory (1973).
* **Main Path Analysis (MPA)**: Map the transition from early descriptive reporting (2001) to the theoretical frameworks of Wright (2007) and the behavioral foundations established by Hayter (2011-2017).
* **The Contemporary Turn**: Identify the recent shift toward diversification, sustainability, and digitalization as the new "structural backbone" of the field.

## 3. Methodology: A Multi-Methodological Counterproof
* **Dataset Architecture**: Longitudinal analysis of 1,294 Web of Science records (1988-2025).
* **Structural Refinement**: Application of the **Disparity Filter** ($\alpha=0.05$) to extract the network backbone, identifying 30 distinct research communities.
* **The NLP Counterproof**: Contrastive analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) vs. BERTopic (Transformer-based embeddings).
* **Metric Rigor**: Utilizing the Herfindahl Index (0.536 at k=10) to prove semantic dispersion in frequency-based models.

## 4. Results: Mapping the Semantic Frontier
* **The Consolidated Core (98%)**: Analysis of mature clusters: *Academic Entrepreneurship*, *Innovation*, and *University Spin-offs*.
* **The Digital Signal (2%)**: Documentation of the "Digital Frontier" (Topic 0) isolated exclusively by semantic sensitivity.
* **Temporal Burst Detection**: Analyzing the 2024-2025 surge in keywords such as "PhD Students," "Sustainability," and "Ecosystems" as catalysts for the digital turn.



## 5. Theoretical Development: A Multilevel Perspective
* **Macro-Level (Institutional Logics)**: Defining Digitalization as a "Parasitic Logic" that occupies traditional terminological spaces while altering fundamental commercialization meanings.
* **Meso-Level (Intermediary Coordination)**: Re-theorizing Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) as digital orchestrators rather than physical asset managers.
* **Micro-Level (Individual Foundations)**: The rising agency of "PhD Students" and "Doctoral Students" in navigating the tensions between scientific purity and digital agility.

## 6. Discussion: Legitimacy and Performance
* **The Performance Measurement Paradox**: Discussing how the 2% digital signal challenges existing KPIs focused on physical patents.
* **Ecosystem Transparency**: Addressing the SI’s call regarding how data infrastructures shape ecosystem coordination and growth.

## 7. Conclusion: Navigating the Frontier
* **Summary of Contribution**: Validating the "Weak Signal Hypothesis" through neural topic modeling.
* **Managerial Implications**: Strategies for university administrators to capture the latent value of digital entrepreneurship.
* **Future Research**: Expanding the analysis to LLM-driven venture creation and full-text semantic depth.
