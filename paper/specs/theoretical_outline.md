## Paper Title (Working)
**Hybridizing Logics in Academic Entrepreneurship: A Multilevel Analysis of Emerging Digital Frontiers**

## Core Argument

Academic entrepreneurship has evolved from a contested space of competing institutional logics (academic vs. entrepreneurial) to a hybridized domain where logics coexist and mutually constitute each other. This hybridization, evidenced by exceptional semantic cohesion (98% of literature in one cluster), paradoxically obscures emerging phenomena—particularly the "Digital Academic Entrepreneurship" frontier that represents only 2% of the corpus yet signals fundamental transformation in knowledge commercialization.

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Institutional Logics Theory
- **Key concepts**: Competing logics, hybridization, selective coupling
- **Application**: Explain why academic entrepreneurship shows high integration
- **Evidence**: Network density = 0.8424, modularity = 0.0408

### 2. Multilevel Theory
- **Micro**: Individual scientist motivations and cognition (Hayter 2011, Hmieleski & Powell 2018)
- **Meso**: University structures and TTOs (Wright et al. 2008, 2009)
- **Macro**: Innovation ecosystems and policy regimes

### 3. Weak Signals Theory
- **Key concept**: Emerging phenomena with high impact but low visibility
- **Application**: Digital as weak signal (2% BERTopic, dispersed in LDA)
- **Methodological innovation**: Semantic detection of emergent logics

## Key Propositions

**P1**: The high semantic cohesion of academic entrepreneurship literature reflects successful logic hybridization rather than field fragmentation.

**P2**: Digital transformation in academic entrepreneurship constitutes a "weak signal" - detectable only through semantic methods due to lexical dispersion across established thematic clusters.

**P3**: The emergence of Digital Academic Entrepreneurship signals a potential third logic (technological) entering the hybridized academic-entrepreneurial space.

## Contribution Matrix

| Dimension | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Theoretical | Extends institutional logics to explain hybridization dynamics; introduces weak signal concept |
| Methodological | BERTopic + LDA triangulation; semantic frontier detection |
| Empirical | Largest bibliometric analysis of academic entrepreneurship (N=1,294) |
| Practical | Identifies underexplored Digital frontier for future research |

## Gap-Contribution Alignment

| Gap | Evidence | Our Response |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| Limited understanding of logic coexistence | High network integration | Hybridization framework |
| Emerging themes invisible to bibliometrics | Digital = 2% cluster | Weak signal methodology |
| Fragmented multilevel analysis | Disconnected Main Path phases | Integrated multilevel model |
